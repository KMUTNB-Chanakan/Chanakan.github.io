                <h1>Computer and Programming</h1>

                <p>Before we begin exploring the concepts of programming, you need to understand
                    a few basic things about computers and how they work.</p>
                <p>The physical devices that a computer is made of are referred to as the computer's
                    hardware. The programs that run on a computer are referred to as software.</p>
                <p>Computers can do such a wide variety of things because they can be
                    programmed. This means that computers are not designed to do just one job, but
                    to do any job that their programs tell them to do. A program is a set of instructions
                    that a computer follows to perform a task.</p>

                <h2><b>How Computer Store DATA</b></h2>
                <p>All data that is stored in a computer is converted to sequences of 0s and 1s.</p>
                <p>A computer's memory is divided into tiny storage locations known as bytes. One
                    byte is only enough memory to store a letter of the alphabet or a small number. In
                    order to do anything meaningful, a computer has to have lots of bytes. Most
                    computers today have millions, or even billions, of bytes of memory.</p>

                <p>A computer's CPU can only understand instructions that are written in machine
                    language. Because people find it very difficult to write entire programs in machine
                    language, other programming languages have been invented. The CPU is an
                    electronic device that is designed to do specific things. In particular, the CPU is
                    designed to perform operations such as the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reading a piece of data from main memory</li>
                    <li>Adding two numbers</li>
                    <li>Subtracting one number from another number</li>
                    <li>Multiplying two numbers</li>
                    <li>Dividing one number by another number</li>
                    <li>Moving a piece of data from one memory location to another</li>
                    <li>Determining whether one value is equal to another value</li>

                </ul>

                <h2 style="color:#ff2515"># low-level language</h2>
                <p>The first assembly language was most likely that developed in the 1940s at Cambridge University for
                    use with a historic
                    computer known as the EDSAC</p>

                <h2><b>high level language</b></h2>
                <p>In the 1950s, a new generation of programming languages known as high-level
                    languages began to appear. A <b style="color:#ff2515">high-level language allows you to create
                        powerful
                        and complex programs without knowing how the CPU works</b> and without writing
                    large numbers of low-level instructions. In addition, most high-level languages use
                    words that are easy to understand. For example, if a programmer were using
                    COBOL (which was one of the early high-level languages created in the 1950s), he
                    or she would write the following instruction to display the message Hello world on
                    the computer screen:<br>
                    <b>DISPLAY "Hello world"</b><br>
                    Python is a modern, high-level programming language that we will use in this
                    course. In Python you would display the message Hello world with the following
                    instruction:<br>
                    <b>print('Hello world')</b>
                </p>

                <h1>Program Design</h1>
                <h2><b>Program development cycle</b></h2>
                <p>Programs must be carefully designed before they are written. During the design
                process, programmers use tools such as pseudocode and flowcharts to create
                models of programs.</p>

                <hr>
                <h2><b>Designing a Programming language</b></h2>
                <p>The process of designing a program is arguably the most important part of the
                cycle. You can think of a program's design as its foundation. If you build a
                house on a poorly constructed foundation, eventually you will find yourself
                doing a lot of work to fix the house! A program's design should be viewed no
                differently. If your program is designed poorly, eventually you will find yourself
                doing a lot of work to fix the program.</p>
                <p>The process of designing a program can be summarised in the following two
                steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Understand the task that the program is to perform.</li>
                    <li>Determine the steps that must be taken to perform the task.</li>
                </ol>
                <hr>
                <h2><b>Task and Steps Example</b></h2>
                <p>For example, suppose someone asks you how to boil water. You might break down
                that task into a series of steps as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pour the desired amount of water into a pot.</li>
                    <li>Put the pot on a stove burner.</li>
                    <li>Turn the burner to high.</li>
                    <li>Watch the water until you see large bubbles rising. When this happens, the
                        water is boiling.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This is an example of an algorithm, which is a set of well-defined logical steps that
                must be taken to perform a task. Notice that the steps in this algorithm are
                sequentially ordered. Step 1 should be performed before step 2, and so on. If a
                person follows these steps exactly as they appear, and in the correct order, he or
                she should be able to boil water successfully.</p>
                <p>A programmer breaks down the task that a program must perform in a similar way.
                An algorithm is created, which lists all of the logical steps that must be taken. For
                example, suppose you have been asked to write a program to calculate and
                display the gross pay for an hourly paid employee. Here are the steps that you
                would take:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Get the number of hours worked.</li>
                    <li>Get the hourly pay rate.</li>
                    <li>Multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly pay rate.</li>
                    <li>Display the result of the calculation that was performed in step 3.</li>

                </ol>
                <p>Of course, this algorithm isn't ready to be executed on the computer. The steps in
                this list have to be translated into code. Programmers commonly use two tools to
                help them accomplish this: pseudocode and flowcharts. Let's look at each of
                these in more detail.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2><b>Pseudocode</b></h2>
                <p>The word “pseudo” means fake, so pseudocode is fake code. It is an informal
                language that has no syntax rules and is not meant to be compiled or executed.
                Instead, programmers use pseudocode to create models, or “mock-ups,” of
                programs. Because programmers don't have to worry about syntax errors while
                writing pseudocode, they can focus all of their attention on the program's design.
                Once a satisfactory design has been created with pseudocode, the pseudocode
                can be translated directly to actual code.</p>
                <pre>Input the hourse worked
Input the hourly pay rate
calculate gross pay as hours worked Multiplied by pay rate
display the gross pay</pre>
                 <hr>
                 <h2><b>Flowchart</b></h2>
                 <p>Flowcharting is another tool that programmers use to design programs. A flowchart
                is a diagram that graphically depicts the steps that take place in a
                program.Notice that there are three types of symbols in the flowchart: ovals,
                parallelograms, and a rectangle. Each of these symbols represents a step in the
                program, as described here:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ovals, which appear at the top and bottom of the flowchart, are called
                    terminal symbols. The Start terminal symbol marks the program's starting point
                    and the End terminal symbol marks the program's ending point.</li>
                    <li>Parallelograms are used as input symbols and output symbols. They represent
                    steps in which the program reads input or displays output.</li>
                    <li>Rectangles are used as processing symbols. They represent steps in which the
                    program performs some process on data, such as a mathematical calculation.</li>
                </ul>
