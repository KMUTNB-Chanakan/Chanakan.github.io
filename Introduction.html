				<h2><b>What Does Programmer Mean?</b></h2>
				<p>A programmer is an individual that writes/creates computer software or applications by giving the
					computer specific programming instructions. Most programmers have a broad computing and coding
					background across multiple programming languages and platforms, including Structured Query Language
					(SQL), Perl, Extensible Markup Language (XML), PHP, HTML, C, C++ and Java.</p>
				<p>A programmer also may specialize in one or more computing fields, like database, security or
					software/firmware/mobile/Web development. These individuals are instrumental to the development of
					computer technology and the field of computing.</p>

				<h2><b>Techopedia Explains Programmer</b></h2>
				<p>A programmer may work in a variety of settings, ranging from small firms to large IT companies, and
					be involved in any of the components related to system programming, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>System conception and design</li>
					<li>System development</li>
					<li>Writing code</li>
					<li>Testing</li>
					<li>Debugging</li>
					<li>Implementation</li>
					<li>Maintenance</li>
					<li>System instructions or programs</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A programmer works according to the specifications provided by a systems analyst or senior
					programmer. After completing a program design, a programmer converts the design into a series of
					codes or instructions that the computer can run and execute, making use of a specific programming
					language and required platforms. After converting the design to code, a programmer runs the code and
					looks for bugs and errors. If a programmer finds code errors, appropriate corrections are applied,
					and the program is re-run. The programmer tries to perfect the code through a process of trial and
					error until reaching an acceptable error level and continues this process throughout the life of a
					program, as software and programs are never truly perfect or finished.<sub><b><a

				<h2><b>What Is Python?</b></h2>
				<p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
					Its high-level built
					in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for
					Rapid Application
					Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components
					together. Python's
					simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program
					maintenance. Python
					supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python
					interpreter and the
					extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major
					platforms, and can be
					freely distributed.</p>
				<p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since
					there is no
					compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a
					bug or bad input
					will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises
					an exception. When
					the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level
					debugger allows inspection
					of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping
					through the code a
					line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's
					introspective power. On the
					other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the
					source: the fast
					edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</p>

					languages.<sub><b><a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/" target="_blank">python.org</a></b></sub></p>

				<h2><b>History of Python</b></h2>
				<p>Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed
					by <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" target="_blank">Guido van Rossum</a></b>
					in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code
					readability, and its
					syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.</p>
				<p>In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started.
					Soon after that,
					Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde &
					Informatica (CWI)
					which is situated in the Netherlands. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was
					looking for an
					interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language in which Python
					is said to have
					succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and
					had the feature of
					exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some
					issues with ABC but
					liked most of the features. After that what he did was really very clever. He had taken the syntax
					of ABC, and some of
					its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had
					created a good
					scripting language that had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC's TV
					Show - 'Monty
					Python's Flying Circus', as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and
					slightly mysterious
					name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life”
					(BDFL) until he stepped
					down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for
					Google, but currently,
					he is working at Dropbox.</p>
				<p>The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express
					the concepts, when
					we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to
					provide code
					readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released it had more than enough
					capability to provide
					classes with inheritance, several core data types exception handling and functions.</p>
				<h3>Following are the illustrations of different versions of Python along with the timeline.</h3>

				<span class="image main"><img src="./insert_images/TIMELINE-python.jpg" alt="" /></span>

				<h3># Python 3.10.4 is the latest stable version. #</h3>
				<p>The two of the most used versions has to Python 2.x & 3.x. There is a lot of competition between the
					two and both of
					them seem to have quite a number of different fanbases.</p>
				<p>For various purposes such as developing, scripting, generation, and software testing, this language
					is utilized. Due to
					its elegance and simplicity, top technology organizations like Dropbox, Google, Quora, Mozilla,
					Hewlett-Packard,
					Qualcomm, IBM, and Cisco have implemented Python.</p>
				<p>Python has come a long way to become the most popular coding language in the world. Python has just
					turned 30 and just
					recently at pycon22(python confrence) a new feature was released by Anaconda foundation it's known
					as pyscript with this
					now python can be written and run in the browser like javascript which was previously not possible,
					but it still has
					that unknown charm & X factor which can be clearly seen from the fact that Google users have
					consistently searched for
					Python much more than they have searched for Kim Kardashian, Donald Trump, Tom Cruise, etc.</p>
				<p>Python has been an inspiration for many other coding languages such as Ruby, Cobra, Boo, CoffeeScript
					ECMAScript,
					Groovy, Swift Go, OCaml, Julia, etc.<sub><b><a

				<h1>Why Python?</h1>

				<h2><b>Comparing Python To Other Languages</b></h2>
				<p><b>Disclaimer</b> : This essay was written sometime in 1997. It shows its age. <br />It is retained
					here merely as a historical
					artifact. -- <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" target="_blank">Guido van
							Rossum</a></b></p>
				<p>Python is often compared to other interpreted languages such as Java, JavaScript, Perl, Tcl, or
					Smalltalk. Comparisons
					to C++, Common Lisp and Scheme can also be enlightening. In this section I will briefly compare
					Python to each of these
					languages. These comparisons concentrate on language issues only. In practice, the choice of a
					programming language is
					often dictated by other real-world constraints such as cost, availability, training, and prior
					investment, or even
					emotional attachment. Since these aspects are highly variable, it seems a waste of time to consider
					them much for this
					comparison.<sub><b><a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons/"
								target="_blank">python.org</a></b></sub></p>
				<pre><code>print('Hello world!')</code></pre>
				<h3>Java</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Python programs are generally expected to run slower than Java programs, but they also take much
						less time to
						develop.
						Python programs are typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java programs. This difference
						can be attributed to
						Python's built-in high-level data types and its dynamic typing. For example, a Python programmer
						wastes no time
						declaring the types of arguments or variables, and Python's powerful polymorphic list and
						dictionary types, for
						which
						rich syntactic support is built straight into the language, find a use in almost every Python
						program. Because of
						the
						run-time typing, Python's run time must work harder than Java's. For example, when evaluating
						the expression a+b, it
						must first inspect the objects a and b to find out their type, which is not known at compile
						time. It then invokes
						the
						appropriate addition operation, which may be an overloaded user-defined method. Java, on the
						other hand, can perform
						an
						efficient integer or floating point addition, but requires variable declarations for a and b,
						and does not allow
						overloading of the + operator for instances of user-defined classes.</p>
					<p>For these reasons, Python is much better suited as a "glue" language, while Java is better
						characterized as a
						low-level
						implementation language. In fact, the two together make an excellent combination. Components can
						be developed in
						Java
						and combined to form applications in Python; Python can also be used to prototype components
						until their design can
						be
						"hardened" in a Java implementation. To support this type of development, a Python
						implementation written in Java is
						under development, which allows calling Python code from Java and vice versa. In this
						implementation, Python source
						code
						is translated to Java bytecode (with help from a run-time library to support Python's dynamic
						semantics).</p>
					<pre><code>public class HelloWord
 {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
 } </code></pre>
				</blockquote>
				<h3>Javascript</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Python's "object-based" subset is roughly equivalent to JavaScript. Like JavaScript (and unlike
						Java), Python
						supports a
						programming style that uses simple functions and variables without engaging in class
						definitions. However, for
						JavaScript, that's all there is. Python, on the other hand, supports writing much larger
						programs and better code
						reuse
						through a true object-oriented programming style, where classes and inheritance play an
						important role.</p>
					<pre><code>console.log('Hello World!)</code></pre>
				</blockquote>
				<h3>Perl</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Python and Perl come from a similar background (Unix scripting, which both have long outgrown),
						and sport many
						similar
						features, but have a different philosophy. Perl emphasizes support for common
						application-oriented tasks, e.g. by
						having
						built-in regular expressions, file scanning and report generating features. Python emphasizes
						support for common
						programming methodologies such as data structure design and object-oriented programming, and
						encourages programmers
						to
						write readable (and thus maintainable) code by providing an elegant but not overly cryptic
						notation. As a
						consequence,
						Python comes close to Perl but rarely beats it in its original application domain; however
						Python has an
						applicability
						well beyond Perl's niche.</p>
					<pre><code>print('Hello World!');</code></pre>
				</blockquote>
				<h3>C++</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Almost everything said for Java also applies for C++, just more so: where Python code is
						typically 3-5 times shorter
						than equivalent Java code, it is often 5-10 times shorter than equivalent C++ code! Anecdotal
						evidence suggests that one
						Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't complete in a year.
						Python shines as a glue
						language, used to combine components written in C++.</p>
					<pre><code>#include < iostream >
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout << "hello World!";

	return 0;
}</code></pre>

				</blockquote>
				<h3>Common Lisp and Scheme</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<P>These languages are close to Python in their dynamic semantics, but so different in their
						approach to syntax that a
						comparison becomes almost a religious argument: is Lisp's lack of syntax an advantage or a
						disadvantage? It should be
						noted that Python has introspective capabilities similar to those of Lisp, and Python programs
						can construct and execute
						program fragments on the fly. Usually, real-world properties are decisive: Common Lisp is big
						(in every sense), and the
						Scheme world is fragmented between many incompatible versions, where Python has a single, free,
						compact implementation.</P>

				<h1>Compiler VS Interpreter</h1>

				<span class="image main"><img src="./insert_images/Compiler-VS-Interpreter.png" alt=""></span>
				<h2><b>Key Difference between Compiler and Interpreter</b></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Compiler transforms code written in a high-level programming language into the machine code at
						once before the program
						runs, whereas an Interpreter converts each high-level program statement, one by one, into the
						machine code, during
						program run.</li>
					<li>Compiled code runs faster, while interpreted code runs slower.</li>
					<li>Compiler displays all errors after compilation, on the other hand, the Interpreter displays
						errors of each line one by
						one.</li>
					<li>Compiler is based on translation linking-loading model, whereas the Interpreter is based on
						Interpretation Method.</li>
					<li>Compiler takes an entire program, whereas the Interpreter takes a single line of code.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2><b>What is Compiler?</b></h2>
				<p>A compiler is a computer program that transforms code written in a high-level programming language
					into the machine
					code. It is a program which translates the human-readable code to a language a computer processor
					understands (binary 1
					and 0 bits). The computer processes the machine code to perform the corresponding tasks.</p>
				<p>A compiler should comply with the syntax rule of that programming language in which it is written.
					However, the compiler
					is only a program and can not fix errors found in that program. So, if you make a mistake, you need
					to make changes in
					the syntax of your program. Otherwise, it will not compile.</p>
				<H2><B>What is Interpreter?</B></H2>
				<P>An interpreter is a computer program, which converts each high-level program statement into the
					machine code. This
					includes source code, pre-compiled code, and scripts. Both compiler and interpreters do the same job
					which is converting
					higher level programming language to machine code. However, a compiler will convert the code into
					machine code (create
					an exe) before program run. Interpreters convert code into machine code when the program is run.</P>

						text that a programmer writes into a format the CPU can understand.</li>
					<li>The process of compilation is relatively complicated. It spends a lot of time analyzing and
						processing the program.</li>
					<li>The executable result is some form of machine-specific binary code.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2><b>Role of Interpreter</b></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The interpreter converts the source code line-by-line during RUN Time.</li>
					<li>Interpret completely translates a program written in a high-level language into machine level
						language.</li>
					<li>Interpreter allows evaluation and modification of the program while it is executing.</li>
					<li>Relatively less time spent for analyzing and processing the program</li>
					<li>Program execution is relatively slow compared to compiler</li>
				</ul>
				<h2><b>HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES</b></h2>
				<p>High-level languages, like C, C++, JAVA, etc., are very near to English. It makes programming process
					easy. However, it
					must be translated into machine language before execution. This translation process is either
					conducted by either a
					compiler or an interpreter. Also known as source code.</p>
				<h2><b>MACHINE CODE</b></h2>
				<p>Machine languages are very close to the hardware. Every computer has its machine language. A machine
					language programs
					are made up of series of binary pattern. (Eg. 110110) It represents the simple operations which
					should be performed by
					the computer. Machine language programs are executable so that they can be run directly.</p>
				<h2><b>OBJECT CODE</b></h2>
				<p>On compilation of source code, the machine code generated for different processors like Intel, AMD,
					and ARM is
					different. To make code portable, the source code is first converted to Object Code. It is an
					intermediary code (similar
					to machine code) that no processor will understand. At run time, the object code is converted to the
					machine code of the
					underlying platform.</p>
				<h2><b>Java is both Compiled and Interpreted.</b></h2>
				<p>To exploit relative advantages of compilers are interpreters some programming language like Java are
					both compiled and
					interpreted. The Java code itself is compiled into Object Code. At run time, the JVM interprets the
					Object code into
					machine code of the target computer.<sub><b><a
