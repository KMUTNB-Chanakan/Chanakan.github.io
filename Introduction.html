								<h2><b>What Does Programmer Mean?</b></h2>
								<p>A programmer is an individual that writes/creates computer software or applications by giving the computer specific programming instructions. Most programmers have a broad computing and coding background across multiple programming languages and platforms, including Structured Query Language (SQL), Perl, Extensible Markup Language (XML), PHP, HTML, C, C++ and Java.</p>
								<p>A programmer also may specialize in one or more computing fields, like database, security or software/firmware/mobile/Web development. These individuals are instrumental to the development of computer technology and the field of computing.</p>

								<h2><b>Techopedia Explains Programmer</b></h2>
								<p>A programmer may work in a variety of settings, ranging from small firms to large IT companies, and be involved in any of the components related to system programming, including:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>System conception and design</li>
										<li>System development</li>
										<li>Writing code</li>
										<li>Testing</li>
										<li>Debugging</li>
										<li>Implementation</li>
										<li>Maintenance</li>
										<li>System instructions or programs</li>
									</ul>
								<p>A programmer works according to the specifications provided by a systems analyst or senior programmer. After completing a program design, a programmer converts the design into a series of codes or instructions that the computer can run and execute, making use of a specific programming language and required platforms. After converting the design to code, a programmer runs the code and looks for bugs and errors. If a programmer finds code errors, appropriate corrections are applied, and the program is re-run. The programmer tries to perfect the code through a process of trial and error until reaching an acceptable error level and continues this process throughout the life of a program, as software and programs are never truly perfect or finished.<sub><b><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4813/programmer">techopedia.com</a></b></sub></p>
								<h2><b>The Way Of The Program</b></h2>
								<h3>"The single most important skill for a computer scientist is <b>problem solving</b>."</h3>
								<p>Problem solving means <u>the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution
										clearly and accurately</u>. As it turns out, the process of <u>learning to program is an excellent opportunity
										to practice problem solving skills</u>. That's why this chapter is called, “The way of the program”.</p>

								<h3>Formal languages</h3>
								<blockquote>
									Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that
									mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and
									symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:

								<h2><b>What Is Python?</b></h2>
								<p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built
								in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application
								Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's
								simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python
								supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the
								extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be
								freely distributed.</p>
								<p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no
								compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input
								will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When
								the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection
								of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a
								line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the
								other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast
								edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</p>

								<h2><b>History of Python</b></h2>
								<p>Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a></b>
								in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its
								syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.</p>
								<p>In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that,
								Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)
								which is situated in the Netherlands. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an
								interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language in which Python is said to have
								succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of
								exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but
								liked most of the features. After that what he did was really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of
								its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good
								scripting language that had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC's TV Show - 'Monty
								Python's Flying Circus', as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious
								name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped
								down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently,
								he is working at Dropbox.</p>
								<p>The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when
								we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code
								readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released it had more than enough capability to provide
								classes with inheritance, several core data types exception handling and functions.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="./insert_images/TIMELINE-python.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<h3># Python 3.10.4 is the latest stable version. #</h3>
								<p>The two of the most used versions has to Python 2.x & 3.x. There is a lot of competition between the two and both of
								them seem to have quite a number of different fanbases.</p>
								<p>For various purposes such as developing, scripting, generation, and software testing, this language is utilized. Due to
								its elegance and simplicity, top technology organizations like Dropbox, Google, Quora, Mozilla, Hewlett-Packard,
								Qualcomm, IBM, and Cisco have implemented Python.</p>
								<p>Python has come a long way to become the most popular coding language in the world. Python has just turned 30 and just
								recently at pycon22(python confrence) a new feature was released by Anaconda foundation it’s known as pyscript with this
								now python can be written and run in the browser like javascript which was previously not possible, but it still has
								that unknown charm & X factor which can be clearly seen from the fact that Google users have consistently searched for
								Python much more than they have searched for Kim Kardashian, Donald Trump, Tom Cruise, etc.</p>
								<p>Python has been an inspiration for many other coding languages such as Ruby, Cobra, Boo, CoffeeScript ECMAScript,
								Groovy, Swift Go, OCaml, Julia, etc.<sub><b><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/history-of-python/">geeksforgeeks.org</a></b></sub></p>

							<h1>Why Python</h1>
							
							<h2><b>Comparing Python To Other Languages</b></h2>
							<p><b>Disclaimer</b> : This essay was written sometime in 1997. It shows its age. <br/>It is retained here merely as a historical
							artifact. -- <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a></b></p>
							<p>Python is often compared to other interpreted languages such as Java, JavaScript, Perl, Tcl, or Smalltalk. Comparisons
							to C++, Common Lisp and Scheme can also be enlightening. In this section I will briefly compare Python to each of these
							languages. These comparisons concentrate on language issues only. In practice, the choice of a programming language is
							often dictated by other real-world constraints such as cost, availability, training, and prior investment, or even
							emotional attachment. Since these aspects are highly variable, it seems a waste of time to consider them much for this
							comparison.<sub><b><a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons/">python.org</a></b></sub></p>
							<pre><code>print('Hello world!')</code></pre>
							<h3>Java</h3>
								<blockquote>
									<p>Python programs are generally expected to run slower than Java programs, but they also take much less time to
										develop.
										Python programs are typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java programs. This difference can be attributed to
										Python's built-in high-level data types and its dynamic typing. For example, a Python programmer wastes no time
										declaring the types of arguments or variables, and Python's powerful polymorphic list and dictionary types, for
										which
										rich syntactic support is built straight into the language, find a use in almost every Python program. Because of
										the
										run-time typing, Python's run time must work harder than Java's. For example, when evaluating the expression a+b, it
										must first inspect the objects a and b to find out their type, which is not known at compile time. It then invokes
										the
										appropriate addition operation, which may be an overloaded user-defined method. Java, on the other hand, can perform
										an
										efficient integer or floating point addition, but requires variable declarations for a and b, and does not allow
										overloading of the + operator for instances of user-defined classes.</p>
									<p>For these reasons, Python is much better suited as a "glue" language, while Java is better characterized as a
										low-level
										implementation language. In fact, the two together make an excellent combination. Components can be developed in
										Java
										and combined to form applications in Python; Python can also be used to prototype components until their design can
										be
										"hardened" in a Java implementation. To support this type of development, a Python implementation written in Java is
										under development, which allows calling Python code from Java and vice versa. In this implementation, Python source
										code
										is translated to Java bytecode (with help from a run-time library to support Python's dynamic semantics).</p>
									<pre><code>public class HelloWord
 {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
 } </code></pre>
								</blockquote>
							<h3>Javascript</h3>
								<blockquote>
									<p>Python's "object-based" subset is roughly equivalent to JavaScript. Like JavaScript (and unlike Java), Python
										supports a
										programming style that uses simple functions and variables without engaging in class definitions. However, for
										JavaScript, that's all there is. Python, on the other hand, supports writing much larger programs and better code
										reuse
										through a true object-oriented programming style, where classes and inheritance play an important role.</p>
									<pre><code>console.log('Hello World!)</code></pre>
								</blockquote>
							<h3>Perl</h3>
								<blockquote>
									<p>Python and Perl come from a similar background (Unix scripting, which both have long outgrown), and sport many
										similar
										features, but have a different philosophy. Perl emphasizes support for common application-oriented tasks, e.g. by
										having
										built-in regular expressions, file scanning and report generating features. Python emphasizes support for common
										programming methodologies such as data structure design and object-oriented programming, and encourages programmers
										to
										write readable (and thus maintainable) code by providing an elegant but not overly cryptic notation. As a
										consequence,
										Python comes close to Perl but rarely beats it in its original application domain; however Python has an
										applicability
										well beyond Perl's niche.</p>
									<pre><code>print('Hello World!');</code></pre>
								</blockquote>
							<h3>C++</h3>
								<blockquote>
									<p>Almost everything said for Java also applies for C++, just more so: where Python code is typically 3-5 times shorter
									than equivalent Java code, it is often 5-10 times shorter than equivalent C++ code! Anecdotal evidence suggests that one
									Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't complete in a year. Python shines as a glue
									language, used to combine components written in C++.</p>
									<pre><code>#include < iostream >
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout << "hello World!";

	return 0;
}</code></pre>
								
								</blockquote>
							<h3>Common Lisp and Scheme</h3>
								<blockquote>
									<P>These languages are close to Python in their dynamic semantics, but so different in their approach to syntax that a
									comparison becomes almost a religious argument: is Lisp's lack of syntax an advantage or a disadvantage? It should be
									noted that Python has introspective capabilities similar to those of Lisp, and Python programs can construct and execute
									program fragments on the fly. Usually, real-world properties are decisive: Common Lisp is big (in every sense), and the
									Scheme world is fragmented between many incompatible versions, where Python has a single, free, compact implementation.</P>
