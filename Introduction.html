								<h2><b>What Does Programmer Mean?</b></h2>
								<p>A programmer is an individual that writes/creates computer software or applications by giving the computer specific programming instructions. Most programmers have a broad computing and coding background across multiple programming languages and platforms, including Structured Query Language (SQL), Perl, Extensible Markup Language (XML), PHP, HTML, C, C++ and Java.</p>
								<p>A programmer also may specialize in one or more computing fields, like database, security or software/firmware/mobile/Web development. These individuals are instrumental to the development of computer technology and the field of computing.</p>

								<h2><b>Techopedia Explains Programmer</b></h2>
								<p>A programmer may work in a variety of settings, ranging from small firms to large IT companies, and be involved in any of the components related to system programming, including:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>System conception and design</li>
										<li>System development</li>
										<li>Writing code</li>
										<li>Testing</li>
										<li>Debugging</li>
										<li>Implementation</li>
										<li>Maintenance</li>
										<li>System instructions or programs</li>
									</ul>
								<p>A programmer works according to the specifications provided by a systems analyst or senior programmer. After completing a program design, a programmer converts the design into a series of codes or instructions that the computer can run and execute, making use of a specific programming language and required platforms. After converting the design to code, a programmer runs the code and looks for bugs and errors. If a programmer finds code errors, appropriate corrections are applied, and the program is re-run. The programmer tries to perfect the code through a process of trial and error until reaching an acceptable error level and continues this process throughout the life of a program, as software and programs are never truly perfect or finished.<sub><b><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4813/programmer">techopedia.com</a></b></sub></p>
								<h2><b>The Way Of The Program</b></h2>
								<h3>"The single most important skill for a computer scientist is <b>problem solving</b>."</h3>
								<p>Problem solving means <u>the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution
										clearly and accurately</u>. As it turns out, the process of <u>learning to program is an excellent opportunity
										to practice problem solving skills</u>. That's why this chapter is called, “The way of the program”.</p>

								<h2><b>Programming Language</b></h2>
								<h3>Natural languages</h3>
								<blockquote>
									Natural languages are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by
									people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.
								</blockquote>
								<h3>Formal languages</h3>
								<blockquote>
									Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that
									mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and
									symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:

								<h3>Programming languages</h3>

								<h2><b>What Is Python?</b></h2>
								<p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built
								in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application
								Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's
								simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python
								supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the
								extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be
								freely distributed.</p>
								<p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no
								compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input
								will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When
								the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection
								of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a
								line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the
								other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast
								edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</p>

								<h2><b>History of Python</b></h2>
								<p>Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum
								in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its
								syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.</p>
								<p>In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that,
								Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)
								which is situated in the Netherlands. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an
								interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language in which Python is said to have
								succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of
								exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but
								liked most of the features. After that what he did was really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of
								its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good
								scripting language that had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC's TV Show - 'Monty
								Python's Flying Circus', as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious
								name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped
								down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently,
								he is working at Dropbox.</p>
